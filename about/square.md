# music game made by Pygame Zero
An art festival was coming soon in our school,so my friend Jack[^1] asked me to make a game.
We all like music games very much(such as Phigros and Arcaea),then we wanted to make a music game by Scratch[^2].
I made it for almost a month,then I met a lot of questions.
At this time,I learned pyinstaller,it can build python files as a exe file.
It's a good way,and I learned Pygame Zero to make a game easily
So I'm using python to make game now
source will upload to GitHub soon
Actually it's unfinished
## What did/will we do:
[] upload exe file
[] finish the simple game
